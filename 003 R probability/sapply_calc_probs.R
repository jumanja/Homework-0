# Key points
# Some functions automatically apply element-wise to vectors, such as sqrt() and *.
# However, other functions do not operate element-wise by default. This includes functions we define ourselves.
# The function sapply(x, f) allows any other function f to be applied element-wise to the vector x.

# The probability of an event happening is 1 minus the probability of that event not happening:
  
#   Pr(event)=1‚àíPr(no event) 
# We can compute the probability of shared birthdays mathematically:
  
#   Pr(shared birthdays)=1‚àíPr(no shared birthdays)=1‚àí(1√ó364365√ó363365√ó...√ó365‚àíùëõ+1365) 
# Code: Function for birthday problem Monte Carlo simulations
# Note that the function body of compute_prob() is the code that we wrote in the previous video. If we write this code as a function, we can use sapply() to apply this function to several values of n.
