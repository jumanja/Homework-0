Key points
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) says that the distribution of the sum of a random variable is approximated by a normal distribution.

The expected value of a random variable,  E[𝑋]=𝜇 , is the average of the values in the urn. This represents the expectation of one draw. 
The standard error of one draw of a random variable is the standard deviation of the values in the urn.
The expected value of the sum of draws is the number of draws times the expected value of the random variable. 
The standard error of the sum of independent draws of a random variable is the square root of the number of draws times the standard deviation of the urn. 
Equations
These equations apply to the case where there are only two outcomes,  𝑎  and  𝑏  with proportions  𝑝  and  1−𝑝  respectively. The general principles above also apply to random variables with more than two outcomes.

Expected value of a random variable: 
𝑎𝑝+𝑏(1−𝑝) 
Expected value of the sum of n draws of a random variable: 
𝑛×(𝑎𝑝+𝑏(1−𝑝)) 
Standard deviation of an urn with two values: 
∣𝑏–𝑎∣𝑝(1−𝑝)‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√ 

Standard error of the sum of n draws of a random variable:
𝑛√ ×∣𝑏–𝑎∣𝑝(1−𝑝)‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√
